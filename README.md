# Functional programming in Javascript
Well, I build this repository, because I consider it necessary to give my opinion based on my experience on how it is the best way to **check data types** in our projects using javascript. I think that JS is a great language that today is changing many ways of how to program, all this makes many programmers the lack of a static type checking system in variables at the time of compilation, causes in many people fear and uncertainty on how to handle certain aspects of an application

## In this repository we will learn about this concepts:
- Lazy
- Monoid
- Monad
- Functor
- Curry
- Lambda
- Recursion
- Closure
- Stateless
- Compose
- High order functions
- Pure functions
- First Class
- Side effects

## Monoid:
https://marmelab.com/blog/2018/04/18/functional-programming-2-monoid.html

The term Monoid comes from category theory. It describes a set of elements which has 3 special properties when combined with a particular operation, often named concat:

The operation must combine two values of the set into a third value of the same set. If a and b are part of the set, then concat(a, b) must also be part of the set. In category theory, this is called a magma.
The operation must be associative: concat(x, concat(y, z)) must be the same as concat(concat(x, y), z) where x, y, and z are any value in the set. No matter how you group the operation, the result should be the same, as long as the order is respected.
The set must possess a neutral element in regard to the operation. If that neutral element is combined with any other value, it should not change it. concat(element, neutral) == concat(neutral, element) == element

## Functor:
https://medium.com/@dtinth/what-is-a-functor-dcf510b098b6
A functor is simply something that can be mapped over. Is anything that can be use a map.
In practice a functor represents a type that can be mapped over.

## Pure functions:
Only transforms inputs in outpus.

## Side effects:
Is when a function make other things more than return somethings.

## High order functions:
Functions that receive an other functions as input/output.

## Recursion:
Dont iretate: use map, filter, reduce.
avoid mutation data:avoid tp change data, make or use a function to return a new data, but modify directly.}
persiste data structures for inmutability, example inmutable js or use this id of the tree. mori / inmutable.js

## Closure:
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

## Stateless:
Stateless programming is a paradigm in which the operations (functions, methods, procedures, whatever you call them) you implement are not sensitive to the state of the computation. That means all the data used in an operation are passed as inputs to the operation, and all the data used by whatever operations invoked that operation are passed back as outputs. In practice, this means the program must have Value semantics (it is not permitted to modify shared/aliased data structures, and objects do not have an identity), must not use global or class variables, and all input/output must be handled specially (such as through monads or by threading an I/O state through any parts of the computation that perform I/O). Exception handling may also make the computation stateful.

## Compose:
Combine, functions' effects to create a pipeline through which our program's data can flow through.
